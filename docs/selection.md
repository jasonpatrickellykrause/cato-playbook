# Control Selection

[SD Elements](https://www.securitycompass.com/sdelements/) is used to generate security requirements. Tasks are mapped 
back to NIST 800-53 controls. We use a phased approach to control implementation by addressing higher risk tasks first. 

- Security requirements are tailored to the application (system) using a survey. Privacy controls are added based upon 
system categorization
- Security tasks are generated from the survey and injected into the product backlog for prioritization and execution
- Engineers implement controls and provide evidence that is evaluated by an assessor. Direct references to code are 
provided for both evaluation and traceability.
