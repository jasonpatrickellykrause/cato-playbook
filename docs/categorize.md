# Categorize

The Categorize step remains largely the same, but is the first opportunity to show that RMF tasks (C-1, C-2, & C-3) can be done more quickly with a cross-functional team (people aspect). As mentioned in previous sections, it’s essential to have technical assessors in place, along with highly competent infrastructure, platform, and pilot application teams. 

## System Security Plan (SSP)

Start SSP development utilizing guidance from [NIST Special Publication 800-18, Revision 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/18/r1/final). See note in Implementation & Assessment about SSP digitization and automation. Typical SSP templates will include the following:
1. Information System Name
2. Risk Categorization (following FIPS 199 & 200 guidance)
3. Information System Owner
4. Authorizing Official
5. Additional Key Personnel for the Information System
6. General description and purpose of the Information System
7. General description of the technical stack details
8. List of external system integration details (i.e. system name, organization ownership, agreement (ISA, MOU or MOA), risk categorization, authorization status, and authorizing official)
9. Unique laws, regulations or policies
10. In-scope security and privacy controls
11. Date of completion/update
12. Date of approval with evidence
