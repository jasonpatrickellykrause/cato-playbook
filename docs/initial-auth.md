# Initial Authorization

Submit your authorization package and meet with the Authorizing Official! The good news is that assessors have been involved throughout the entire system life cycle, and the remediation process is already complete. The new level of trust and transparency, in our experience, results in a very smooth initial authorization that is virtually guaranteed.

Congratulations, the work has only just begun!
