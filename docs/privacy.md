# Privacy Analysis

## What is a Privacy Analysis?
The privacy analysis process determines whether or not your system will have any interactions (eg collection, processing, storing, transmission, etc.) with privacy data types. The privacy analysis begins with a privacy threshold assessment (PTA). The purpose of the PTA is to identify the use of both personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI) and determine if a privacy impact analysis (PIA) is needed.

<br/>

## Why is this important?
The purpose of conducting a privacy analysis, is to identify the level and impact of privacy risks in relation to your system, the data and how the system and data plan to be used. This assesssment will determine what additional security and privacy controls must be addressed before shipping your application(s) to production.

:material-information-outline: We expect the majority of applications in the VA will require both a PTA and PIA due to the nature of our business.

## How do I accomplish this task?
We leverage the VA's Privacy Office organization for privacy analysis. To initiate this activity, you should contact your assigned System Steward to coordinate a PTA, and if necessary, a PIA with a Privacy Officer. Don't have an assigned System Steward? Reach out to us on slack at [lighthouse-delivery-platform-support](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C03UA9MV1EH), and we can help pair you up.
