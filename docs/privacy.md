# Privacy Analysis

## What is Privacy Analysis?
The privacy analysis process determines whether or not your system will have any interactions (eg collection, processing, storing, transmission, etc.) with privacy data types. The privacy analysis begins with a privacy threshold assessment (PTA). The purpose of the PTA is to identify the use of both personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI) and determine if a privacy impact analysis (PIA) is needed.

<br/>

## Why are they important?
The purpose of conducting a privacy analysis, is to identify the level and impact of privacy risks in relation to your system, the data and how the system and data plan to be used. This assesssment will determine what additional security and privacy controls must be addressed before shipping your application(s) to production.

:material-information-outline: We expect the majority of applications in the VA will require both a PTA and PIA due to the nature of our business.

## How do I complete this task?
We leverage the VA's Privacy Office organization for privacy analysis. To initiate this activity, you should contact your assigned forcal from Team Owls to coordinate a PTA, and if necessary, a PIA with a Privacy Officer. Don't remember who your assigned focal is from Team Owls? Reach out to them on slack at [team-owls](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C040UBT08TE) on slack, and they will help confirm for you.
