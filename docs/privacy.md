# Privacy Analysis

## What is Privacy Analysis?
The privacy analysis process determines whether or not your system will have any interactions (e.g. collection, processing, storing, transmission, etc.) with privacy data types. The privacy analysis begins with a Privacy Threshold Assessment (PTA). The purpose of the PTA is to confirm whether a system presents any risks towards data privacy. This exercise also helps determine if a Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA), or any other privacy controls, will be required by your organization.

## Why are they important?
The purpose of conducting a privacy analysis, is to identify the level and impact of privacy risks in relation to your system, as well as how you intend to leverage the data for your systems various functions. This assesssment will determine what additional security and privacy controls must be addressed before shipping your application(s) to production.

## How do I complete this task?
As privacy programs and organizations are introduced, teams will follow their organizations preferred processes that are based on the [NIST Special Publication 800-122](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf) as guide.
