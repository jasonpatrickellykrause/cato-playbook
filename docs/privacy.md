# Privacy Analysis

We perform a privacy analysis to identify any use of personally identifiable information (PII) within each application.
The analysis allows us to prescribe additional privacy protections commensurate with the impact due to its loss. We 
leverage an existing process within the VA for privacy. Reach out to us on slack at [vaapi-cato](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C03G2J6G7AR)
to initiate a privacy analysis.
