# Privacy Analysis

We leverage the VA's Privacy Service organization for our privacy analysis. Reach out to us on slack at
[vaapi-cato-support](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C03G2J6G7AR) to initiate a privacy analysis.

The privacy analysis begins with a privacy threshold assessment (PTA). The purpose of the PTA is to identify the use of 
both personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI) and determine if a privacy impact 
analysis (PIA) is needed.

The purpose of the privacy impact analysis is to identify the privacy risks associated with the use of PII and PHI as 
well as to ensure appropriate protections (eg privacy controls) are in place.

We expect the majority of our applications (eg APIs) will require both a PTA and PIA due to the nature of our business.
