# Privacy Analysis

## What is Privacy Analysis?
The privacy analysis process determines whether or not your system will have any interactions (eg collection, processing, storing, transmission, etc.) with privacy data types. The privacy analysis begins with a privacy threshold assessment (PTA). The purpose of the PTA is to identify the use of both personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI) and determine if a privacy impact analysis (PIA) is needed.

## Why are they important?
The purpose of conducting a privacy analysis, is to identify the level and impact of privacy risks in relation to your system, the data and how the system and data plan to be used. This assesssment will determine what additional security and privacy controls must be addressed before shipping your application(s) to production.

## How do I complete this task?
As privacy programs and organizations are introduced, teams will follow standard NIST special publications[^1].
