# Categorization

We perform an analysis that informs subsequent risk management processes by determining the adverse impact due to the 
loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and data. We leverage an existing process within the VA 
for system categorization. Reach out to us on slack at [vaapi-cato](https://lighthouseva.slack.com/archives/C03G2J6G7AR)
to initiate a system categorization.
