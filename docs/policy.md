# Policy-as-Code 

## What are policies?
Policies are considered our rules of engagement for utilizing a cATO process that enables continuous delivery of software into production. Policies that are only verbally agreed upon, and typically adhered to by manual processes, are weaker forms of enforcement in terms of assurance, agility, and speed.

## Is there a better way?
The combination of the secure release pipeline, and the embedding of Security Control Assessors, are examples on how to drastically improve policy's for your cATO for three main reasons:

1. Security Control Assessors have shared context about a systems risk, changes in risk and provide cybersecurity depth rather than becoming compliance and process experts.
2. The secure release pipeline can support built-in criteria for security vulnerability and requirements management through gate check functionality that can automate decision-making of whether to sign images or not (i.e. forms of authorizations).
3. Because you can define policies-as-code, you can quickly scale your cATO operations to all System Owning teams that ship onto your platform.
