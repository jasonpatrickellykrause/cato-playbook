# Policy-as-Code 

## What are policies?
Policies are considered our rules of engagement for utilizing our cATO processes to continuously deliver software into production. Policies that are verbally agreed upon, and typically adhered to by manual processes, are weaker forms of enforcement in terms of assurance and speed.

## Is there a better way?
The combination of the secure release pipeline and the embedding of Security Control Assessors are drastically improved forms of policy for three main reasons:

1. Security Control Assessors have shared context about a systems risk, changes in risk and provide cybersecurity depth rather than compliance and process management.
2. The secure release pipeline will have built-in criteria for security vulnerability and requirements management through its gate check features that automate decision-making of signing images (ie official approvals).
3. Because we're able to define policies-as-code, we are agile in our ability to scale these changes to all customers as needed.
