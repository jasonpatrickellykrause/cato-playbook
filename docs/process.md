The [Risk Management Framework (RMF) for Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final) encourages making the RMF "indistinguishable" from the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by "ensuring the seamless integration of security and privacy protections into organizational systems"[^1]. Below is a depiction of how the risk management steps are integrated into an agile software development. What's important to note is the feedback loop (continuous monitoring) that occurs between the assessment and categorization steps.
