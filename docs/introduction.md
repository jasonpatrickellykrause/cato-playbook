# Intro

Agile is an iterative methodology used within Lighthouse that allows us to quickly deliver software to veterans. Speed 
is achieved utilizing small, incremental changes that are easily shipped into production[^1]. However, the quick
pace of development can often outpace security and compliance practices. Sacrificing security and compliance for speed 
is neither acceptable nor necessary. The Lighthouse cATO playbook is living documentation[^2] describing the people, 
processes and technology we leverage within the security and compliance practice that allow us to move comfortably fast.
