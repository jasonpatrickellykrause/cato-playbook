# Introduction of cATO

As the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) implements Development, Security and Operations (DevSecOps) methodologies, there is an opportunity to implement Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) - also known as continuous Risk Management Framework (cRMF) - practices that will enable real-time monitoring and continuous delivery of secure software. cATO represents a challenging but necessary enhancement of our cyber risk approach in order to accelerate innovation while outpacing expanding cybersecurity threats. The focus shifts to how quickly teams can deliver outcomes[^1] into production for Veterans in a repeatable and reliable way. Speed is achieved utilizing small, incremental changes that are easily shipped into production[^2]. However, the quick pace of development can often outpace security and compliance practices that do not adapt and evolve. Sacrificing security and compliance for speed is neither acceptable nor necessary. 

This Lighthouse cATO playbook is a living document[^3] describing the people, processes and technology we leverage. The intent of this playbook is to help educate readers on our cATO practices in a concise, and consumable way. 

*[cATO]: continuous Authority to Operate
[^1]: What impacts both the behavior of our users, and creates value for the business (anything that is considered functional or non-functional requirements for a given system)
[^2]: An environment where veterans can access the latest version of our software
[^3]: We maintain the documentation so that it represents how we manage cybersecurity risks and threats
