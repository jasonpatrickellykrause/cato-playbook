# Lighthouse DI Platform

## What is a Platform?
Lighthouse Delivery Infrastructure (LHDI) is considered a Platform as a Service (PaaS). This can be broken down as a set of tools, development guidelines and a multi-tenant deployment environment that enables rapid and secure development, deployment and operation of high-quality VA APIs. Our goal is to prioritize developers' efficiency, remove unnecessary waits in their paths to production and make it easy to deliver maximum value.

## Why is this important?
In NIST parlance, the LHDI platform is a common controls provider(CCP)[^1]. This allows us to manage the security posture of the platform instead of our product teams having to manage it. And because our platform leverages the VA's cloud environment, we are common controls consumer as well.
