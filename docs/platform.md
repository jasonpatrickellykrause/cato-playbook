# Platform

## What is a Platform?
A Platform (or a *Platform as a Service* (*PaaS*)) can be broken down as a set of tools, development guidelines and a multi-tenant deployment environment that enables rapid and secure development, deployment and operation of high-quality software. Our goal is to prioritize developers' efficiency, remove unnecessary waits in their paths to production and make it easy to deliver maximum value.

<br/>

## Why is this important?
In NIST parlance, the platform is a common controls provider(CCP)[^1]. This allows us to manage the security posture of the platform instead of our product teams having to manage it. This also allows us to provide a secure and compliant platform to our product teams, which in turn allows them to focus on delivering value to our customers.
