# Platform

## What is a Platform?
A Platform (or a *Platform as a Service* (*PaaS*)) can be broken down as a set of tools, development guidelines and a multi-tenant deployment environment that enables rapid and secure development, deployment and operation of high-quality software. Our goal is to prioritize developers' efficiency, remove unnecessary waits in their paths to production and make it easy to deliver maximum value.

## Why is this important?
In NIST parlance, the platform is a Common Controls Provider (CCP)[^1]. This allows you to manage the security posture of the platform, separately from our mission critical applications. This also allows you to provide a secure and compliant platform as a service to System Owning teams, which in turn allows them to focus more time and energy on delivering value to their users and customers.
