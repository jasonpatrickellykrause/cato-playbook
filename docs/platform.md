# Platform

Our platform gives product teams the ability to develop, test and deploy their applications to customers with ease. Our 
platform is secure, scalable, reliable and easily accessible. The [Delivery Infrastructure](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/lighthouse-di-documentation/)
is a Lighthouse product that supplies operating environments for applications (ie API) using Amazon managed EKS 
clusters. In NIST parlance, we are a common controls provider[^1].This allows us to manage the security posture of the 
platform instead of our product teams having to manage it. And because our platform leverages the VA's cloud 
environment, we are common controls consumer as well.
