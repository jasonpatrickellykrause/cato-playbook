# Plan of Action and Milestones 

## What are POA&Ms?
The Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) describes the actions that are planned to correct deficiencies in a given control identified during the assessment of controls as well as during continuous monitoring. A POA&M includes tasks to be accomplished with a recommendation for completion before or after system authorization; resources required to accomplish the tasks; milestones established to meet the tasks; and the scheduled completion dates for the milestones and tasks. POA&Ms are reviewed by the Authorizing Official (AO) to ensure there is agreement with the remediation actions planned to correct the identified deficiencies.

## When are POA&M mitigations not required?
Deficiencies that are accepted by the AO as residual risk, or, that are remediated during an assessment and before a release, do not require the documentation and monitoring of a POA&M. Residual risk is often covered by other controls that were fully, and successfully addressed.

- Residual risk is defined as risk that remains after efforts to identify and mitigate said risk have been taken.
- Information System Security Officers (ISSO) or Application Security Assessors will monitor for new POA&M items submitted for review, and report them to the as needed AO.
