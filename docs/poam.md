# Plan of Action and Milestones 

## What are POA&Ms?
The Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) describes the actions that are planned to correct deficiencies in a given control identified during the assessment of controls as well as during continuous monitoring. A POA&M includes tasks to be accomplished with a recommendation for completion before or after system authorization; resources required to accomplish the tasks; milestones established to meet the tasks; and the scheduled completion dates for the milestones and tasks. POA&Ms are reviewed by the Authorizing Official (AO) to ensure there is agreement with the remediation actions planned to correct the identified deficiencies.

<br/>

## When are POA&Ms not required?
Deficiencies that are accepted by the AO as `residual risk`, or that are remediated during an assessment and before a release, do not require the documentation and monitoring of a POA&M.

- Residual risk is defined as risk that remains after efforts to identify and mitigate said risk have been taken.
- App Assessors are authorized to make these determinations, and report them to the AO.

<br/>

## How are POA&Ms created in Lighthouse?
When an Application Development Team and their Application Security Assessor determine that a requirement generated by our [Control Selection](selection.md) process will not be fulfilled prior to shipping to production on the LHDI platform, the Application Development Team will confirm the  deficiency and risk details for a given SD Elements countermeasure. These details will be captured as a note within the specific SD Elements countermeasure. An example of this action is shown in the image below, and the following data is required to have a complete POA&M request:

- **Criteria:** the reason why the requirement is applicable to the system
- **Condition:** current condition of the system regarding this requirement
- **Cause:** why this requirement will not be fulfilled prior to shipping to prod
- **Risk Likelihood & Impact:** Low/Medium/High designations and reasons why
- **Mitigation:** the mitigation plan that will be executed
- **Responsible POC:** the key point of contact for this POAM item
- **Assumed Completion Date:** the date the team expects to have addressed mitigated this risk

## How are POA&Ms accepted in Lighthouse?
Once a POA&M request has been established, the Application Security Assessor will review the details with an AO (or a designated delegate). If the risk is accepted, one of the following actions can be taken to update the status of a specific SD Elements countermeasure. An example of how this is displayed to users in the SD Elements UI is shown below.

1. The AO (or a designated delegate) can log into SD Elements, add a note indicating they are accepting the risk action and milestone, and update the verification status to `partial pass`.
2. The Application Security Assessor can update the verification status to `partial pass` as long as they have obtained evidence from the AO (or a designated delegate) that the risk action and milestone has been accepted (e.g. email response), and included within the SD Elements countermeasure as an additional note.

## How are Countermeasure Status vs. Verification Status used?
Every SD Elements countermeasure has a Status that Application Development Teams will update from `Incomplete`, to ultimately one of three available done status's which are `Complete`,`Inherited`, or `Not Applicable`.

- **Complete** means the countermeasure has been addressed, and is ready for an Application Security Assessor to verify the implementation details.
- **Inherited** means that the team believes the countermeasure is completely addressed by another component (e.g. LHDI Platform, a shared authentication service, or even a VA organization that defines specific policies and procedures for all teams to follow), and is ready for an Application Security Assessor to verify. When a team believes a countermeasure is partially inherited, teams should default to using the Complete status.
- **Not Applicable** means that the team believes the countermeasure does not pertain to their system at all, and is ready for an Application Security Assessor to verify.

<br/>

Every SD Elements countermeasure also has a Verification Status, which is used to confirm that the risk identified has been addressed appropriately. Application Security Assessors will update the Verification Status from `no verification status` to either `pass` or `partial pass`. Partial pass is strictly reserved for confirming risk accepted countermeasures as POA&Ms for reporting and traceability purposes. The following combinations of Countermeasure Status and Verification Status are used to indicate specific decisions that have been made with POA&Ms


| **Countermeasure Status**           | **Verification Status**             | **POA&M Action Translation**                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Incomplete`                        | `Partial Pass`                      | Deficient requirement that is backlogged, and will be addressed in future sprints |
| `In Progress`                       | `Partial Pass`                      | Deficient requirement that is actively being addressed                            |
