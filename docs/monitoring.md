# Monitoring

Just like building software, managing risk is a continuous process... it never ends. A successful risk management 
program requires us to treat risk as a first class citizen. And continuously monitoring our security and privacy 
controls is how we will retain confidence in our security posture and program. We've put together a strategy that will 
ensure we remain honest with ourselves:

- Application teams are responsible for continuously managing security and compliance risk for their product. This
means updating documentation and security requirements after changes in implementation.
- Application teams will notify the assessor when they have made changes to the system diagram in order to assess any
new security and privacy risks. Changes may require additional security and privacy controls.
- Assessors are responsible to ensure product teams have addressed security requirements in an appropriate manner.
- Assessors will ensure application teams comply with the [policy](policy.md)
- Assessors will meet with the product team at least every 3 months to ensure documentation and security requirements 
are being maintained.
