# Monitoring

Just like building software, managing risk is a continuous process... it never ends. A successful risk management 
program requires us to treat risk as a first class citizen. And continuously monitoring our security and privacy 
controls is how we will retain confidence in our security posture and program. We've put together a strategy that will 
ensure we remain honest with ourselves:

- Product teams are responsible for continuously managing security and compliance risks that are surfaced by our Aqua, SD Elements and Snyk solutions.
- Product teams and App Assessors are expected to meet at least weekly to discuss upcoming release plans for the product, changes in security vulnerability posture, and any product context that should be updated within SD Elements project surveys. 
- App Assessors are responsible for ensuring product teams are complying with our [policy](policy.md) expectations.
