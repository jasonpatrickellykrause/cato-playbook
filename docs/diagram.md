# System Diagram

We require a system diagram produced by the product team in order to tailor security requirements during the control
selection process. The diagram is also utilized for threat analysis and our [continuous monitoring](monitoring.md) 
strategy. Application teams must include the following items in the diagram:

- Show the connections between components
- Include communication ports and protocols
- Clearly delineate the product (AKA system) boundary
