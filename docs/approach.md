# Overview

The continuous ATO utilizes ongoing authorization within the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST) [Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management) (RMF). Ongoing authorization requires that “security controls and organizational risks are assessed and analyzed at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based security decisions to adequately protect organizational information”[^1]. 

The following principles are critical in supporting our approach within Lighthouse:

- **Cloud Adoption** reduces the amount of authorizations needed across the organization
- **Common Control Inheritance** reduces the amount of security and compliance work for products enabling application teams to deliver products faster
- **Automation** reduces the amount of manual work required for security categorization, control selection, assessment and monitoring
- **Autonomy Requires Accountability** means that application development teams must responsibly manage their systems direct and indirect security risks
- **Never Go At It Alone** means that application security assessors are embedded with application development teams to make risk management balanced and easier
