# Overview

As the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) implements Development, Security and Operations (DevSecOps) methodologies, there is an opportunity to implement Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) - also known as continuous Risk Management Framework (cRMF) - practices that will enable real-time monitoring and continuous delivery of secure software. cATO represents a challenging but necessary enhancement of our cyber risk approach in order to accelerate innovation while outpacing expanding cybersecurity threats. Speed is achieved utilizing small, incremental changes that are easily shipped into production[^1]. However, the quick pace of development can often outpace security and compliance practices that do not adapt and evolve. Sacrificing security and compliance for speed is neither acceptable nor necessary. 

cATO utilizes ongoing authorization within the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST) [Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management) (RMF). Ongoing authorization requires that “security controls and organizational risks are assessed and analyzed at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based security decisions to adequately protect organizational information”[^2]. 

We currently leverage a mixture of new and existing VA practices to support RMF outcomes, which includes the management of security controls that are aligned to your systems unique security risk context via NIST Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations[^3].

## Principles
The following principles are critical to how we enable people, process and technology within Lighthouse:

- **Cloud Adoption** reduces the amount of authorizations needed across the organization
- **Common Control Inheritance** reduces the amount of security and compliance work for products enabling application teams to deliver products faster
- **Automation** reduces the amount of manual work required for security categorization, control selection, assessment and monitoring
- **Autonomy Requires Accountability** means that application development teams must responsibly manage their systems direct and indirect security risks
- **Never Go At It Alone** means that application security assessors are embedded with application development teams to make risk management balanced and easier
