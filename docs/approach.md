# Lighthouse High Level Approach

The Lighthouse (LH) Program AO and Leadership Team, have chosen to run experiments with different strategies that gradually enable and mature their cATO practices. The focus of each experimental adjustment targets increasing transparency of security risks, continuous delivery velocity, and/or overall security culture. This page currently covers a brief description of approaches and adjustments that have supported establishing Ongoing Authorization and cATO for the Lighthouse Program, and will continue to be updated as experiments yield positive outcomes for future enhancements to how we work.

## LH Architecture Inheritance Model
We leverage a modern architecture that allows us to build, deploy and monitor our applications. This is also the foundation to supporting a common control inheritance model through common control providers. At the lowest level, a cloud environment (eg VA Enterprise Cloud) serves as our infrastructure providing flexible AWS compute and storage capabilities. Above that is a modern platform which provides both operating environments (eg [Delivery Infrastructure (DI)](platform.md)) as well as a secure mechanism for shipping applications (eg [Secure Release Pipeline](pipeline.md)).

## LH Ongoing Authorization Boundary

Our Ongoing Authorization Boundary covers the DI Platform, SecRel Pipeline, Applications deployed onto the platform, and any solutions that have been adopted to support the operations of the Platform and SecRel Pipeline (ie Auth0, Circle CI, Snyk, Aqua and SD Elements). Until the Digital Transformation Center (DTC) has secured an ATO for Saas products (Auth0, Synk and CircleCI), the Lighthouse AO has accepted the risk of leveraging these solutions within our Ongoing Authorization boundary. These solutions would fall outside of the Ongoing Authorization boundary scope once they are ATO'd. Both [Github](https://www.oit.va.gov/marketplace/product/details/get/github) and [Datadog](https://www.oit.va.govmarketplace/product/details/get/datadog) have been previously authorized by the VA

## Current Practice Adjustments
This section is dedicated to outlining the incremental and iterative practice adjustments that have been applied within the Lighthouse Program, and which VA directive/handbook the adjustment is aligned to.
