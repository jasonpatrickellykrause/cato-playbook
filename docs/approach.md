# Approach

The continuous ATO utilizes ongoing authorization within the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST)
[Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management) (RMF). Ongoing authorization requires that 
“security controls and organizational risks are assessed and analyzed at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based 
security decisions to adequately protect organizational information”[^1]. We leverage the following principles in support 
of this approach:

- **Cloud Adoption** reduces the amount of authorizations needed across the organization
- **Common Control Inheritance** reduces the amount of security and compliance work for products enabling application 
teams to deliver products faster
- **Automation** reduces the amount of manual work required for security categorization, control selection, assessment
and monitoring
