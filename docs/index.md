# Intro

As the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) implements Development, Security and Operations (DevSecOps) software development methodologies, there is an opportunity to implement Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO) which will support continuously secure software releases. cATO represents a challenging but necessary enhancement of our cyber risk approach in order to accelerate innovation while outpacing expanding cybersecurity threats. 

The move to cATO will require changes to VA’s existing Risk Management Framework (RMF) process to grant and maintain system authorization for software development platforms using low-code development. VA’s current RMF implementation[^1] focuses on obtaining system authorizations (ATOs), but falls short in supporting the speed and agility of modern software development and impending continuous monitoring of risk once system authorization has been reached. 

We care deeply about quickly delivering outcomes[^2] into production for Veterans in a repeatable and reliable way. Speed is achieved utilizing small, incremental changes that are easily shipped into production[^3]. However, the quick pace of development can often outpace security and compliance practices. Sacrificing security and compliance for speed is neither acceptable nor necessary. This Lighthouse cATO playbook is a living document[^4] describing the people, processes and technology we leverage. The intent of this playbook is to help educate readers on our cATO practices in a concise, and consumable way.
