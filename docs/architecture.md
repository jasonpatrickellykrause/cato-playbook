# Architecture
We leverage a modern architecture that allows us to build, deploy and monitor our applications. At the lowest level, a cloud environment serves as our infrastructure providing flexible compute and storage capabilities. Above that is a modern platform which leverages that infrastructure to provide both operating environments (eg [Delivery Infrastructure](platform.md)) and a secure mechanism for shipping applications (eg [Secure Release Pipeline](pipeline.md)).
