# Architecture
We leverage a modern architecture that allows us to build, deploy and monitor our applications. At the lowest level, a 
cloud environment (eg VAEC) serves as our infrastructure providing flexible compute and storage capabilities. Above that 
is a modern platform (eg DI) which provides fundamental services such as endpoint encryption, logging and monitoring. On
top of that we ship our applications with a [Secure & Release (SecRel) Pipeline](pipeline.md).
