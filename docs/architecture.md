# Architecture
We leverage a modern architecture that allows us to build, deploy and monitor our applications. At the lowest level, a 
cloud environment (eg VA Enterprise Cloud) serves as our infrastructure providing flexible compute and storage 
capabilities. Above that is a modern platform which provides both operating environments 
(eg [Delivery Infrastructure](platform.md)) and a secure mechanism for shipping applications 
(eg [Secure Release Pipeline](pipeline.md)).
