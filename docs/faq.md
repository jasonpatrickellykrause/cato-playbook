# Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "Are you allowed to store data outside the VA's intranet?"

    Yes, but the system must be authorized for use by the VA. Additionally, the data stored in the system is limited
    by the system's categorization (impact level). The VA maintains a listing of approved commercial products at
    [https://www.oit.va.gov/marketplace/](https://www.oit.va.gov/marketplace/)

??? question "Are you out of policy for not using va.gov domains?"

    No, the VA Handbook 6102 states that "***VA Websites*** must use the va.gov domain." VA Websites by definition are 
    sites owned and operated by the VA. We utilize va.gov domains for all sites operated with the VA. However, SaaS 
    products (eg [https://www.oit.va.gov/marketplace/](https://www.oit.va.gov/marketplace/)) are owned and operated by 
    commercial entities. These sites operate under domains registered by the vendor.

??? question "Are you storing Protected Health Information (PHI) outside the VA's intranet?"

    No, data is stored within the AWS offering on the VA Enterprise Cloud.
